# Feign Client Java 17 Project with Spring Boot 3 and MySQL

Welcome to the Feign Client Java 17 project, where we explore the efficient integration of Feign Client for consuming external APIs. This project covers everything from basic configuration to the implementation of complete CRUD operations in a MySQL database.

## Key Features

1. **Feign Client for Consuming External APIs:**
   - We use Java 17 and Feign Client to efficiently consume data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

2. **Data Persistence in MySQL:**
   - Learn how to save and manage data in a MySQL database, establishing secure connections.

3. **Complete CRUD Operations:**
   - We implement full CRUD operations for efficient data manipulation in the database.

4. **Data Structure Optimization with Converter and DTO:**
   - Explore optimization strategies using converters and Data Transfer Objects (DTO) for a more efficient data structure.

5. **Swagger Integration in Spring Boot 3:**
   - Document your API clearly and concisely using Swagger. Create detailed documentation to facilitate understanding and usage by other developers.
